## 2026-01-20 | Session 1

Goal:
- Set up project infrastructure

What I did:
- Created folder skeleton
- Initialized git repo
- Added documentation templates

Next:
- Begin parameterizing reactor model

## 2026-01-22 | Session 2

Goal:
- Set up Python infrastructure and physics template

What I did:
- Created python skeletons and config files
- Created conda environment

Next:
- Simple pin cell simulations in hyper-robust environment

## 2026-01-23 | Session 3

Goal:
- Set up pin cell simulation

What I did:
- Fixed VSCode SSH setup with straightedge
- Tested structure created in last session
- Created pin cell geometry and ran simulation on straightedge successfully

Next:
- More complex geometry and transition to optimization problems

## 2026-01-27 | Session 4

Goal:
- Set up simple iterative simulation structure

What I did:
- Set up the python scripts to run multiple solutions in series
- Increased logging from runs, adding .json output and copying the config file seen by the simulation every run

Next: 
- Set up more automated analysis and organization
- Consider future optimization problems

## 2026-01-29 | Session 5

Goal:
- Set up the first experiment, correlating keff with fuel radius and moderation fraction

What I did:
- Demonstrated the increase in neutron energy as moderation decreases
- Observed how the neutron energy spectrum changes in turn

Next:
- Try sweeping other variables
- More sophisticated statistical analysis
